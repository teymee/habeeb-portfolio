              I'm habeeb, an experienced product designer who speaks fluent
              Design and design with business goals at heart . In the last 4
              years, I helped businesses in industries like Fintech, Oil &Gas
              and Artificial intelligence(AI), turn blank pages into bold
              identities and dull interfaces into delightful experiences.

            <div className="">
              Whether it's a web Application, a sleek mobile application, or a
              complete design system, I bring clarity, consistency, and a bit of
              clever charm to the game.

            <div className="">
              But beyond pixels and color palettes, I care about people
              especially users, team members and people who have my best
              interest at heart.

            <div>
              I do always say this to people I work with <br />
              <b>
                “Great design isn't just how it looks, it's how it works, and
                how it makes people feel”.
